Scrobblematic
==============

App that lets you take a photo of an album cover and scrobble it.

Currently uses a image picker from your photo album, but this can be swapped for
a camera view by changing one line of code in SCRTabViewController.

Big thanks to Fadi Hassan for [reverse engineering the Google Goggles API](http://notanothercodeblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/google-goggles-api.html).

- Better error handling
- Don't store user password in plaintext
- Fix UI jankyness when center tab bar controller is highlighted
- Pull-to-refresh recent scrobbles
